# Algod REST API.

API endpoint for algod operations.

**Version:** 0.0.1
**Contact:** contact@algorand.com

This Rust crate provides a client library for the Algod REST API. API.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
algod_client_ffi = "0.0.1"
```

## Usage

```rust
use algod_client_ffi::AlgodClientFfi;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize client (choose one based on your network)
    let client = AlgodClientFfi::localnet();  // For local development
    // let client = AlgodClientFfi::testnet();  // For TestNet
    // let client = AlgodClientFfi::mainnet();  // For MainNet

    // Example: Get network status
    let status = client.get_status().await?;
    println!("Network status: {:?}", status);

    // Example: Get transaction parameters
    let params = client.transaction_params().await?;
    println!("Min fee: {}", params.min_fee);
    println!("Last round: {}", params.last_round);

    // Example: Get account information
    let account_address = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
    let account_info = client.account_information(
        None,  // format
        account_address,
        None,  // exclude
    ).await?;
    println!("Account balance: {}", account_info.amount);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Configuration

The client provides convenient constructors for different networks:

```rust
use algod_client_ffi::AlgodClientFfi;

// For local development (uses localhost:4001 with default API token)
let client = AlgodClientFfi::localnet();

// For Algorand TestNet
let client = AlgodClientFfi::testnet();

// For Algorand MainNet
let client = AlgodClientFfi::mainnet();
```

For custom configurations, you can use a custom HTTP client:

```rust
use algod_client_ffi::AlgodClientFfi;
use algokit_http_client::DefaultHttpClient;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Custom endpoint with API token
let http_client = Arc::new(
    DefaultHttpClient::with_header(
        "http://localhost/",
        "X-API-Key",
        "your-api-key"
    )?
);
let client = AlgodClientFfi::new(http_client);
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example showing how to check network status, get account information, and prepare for transactions:

```rust
use algod_client_ffi::AlgodClientFfi;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect to localnet
    let client = AlgodClientFfi::localnet();

    // Check if the node is healthy and ready
    client.health_check().await?;
    client.get_ready().await?;
    println!("✓ Node is healthy and ready");

    // Get network information
    let status = client.get_status().await?;
    println!("✓ Connected to network");
    println!("  Last round: {}", status.last_round);
    println!("  Catching up: {}", status.catchup_time.unwrap_or(0));

    // Get transaction parameters needed for building transactions
    let params = client.transaction_params().await?;
    println!("✓ Retrieved transaction parameters");
    println!("  Genesis ID: {}", params.genesis_id);
    println!("  Min fee: {}", params.min_fee);

    // Example: Get account information
    let test_address = "7ZUECA7HFLZTXENRV24SHLU4AVPUTMTTDUFUBNBD64C73F3UHRTHAIOF6Q";
    match client.account_information(None, test_address, None).await {
        Ok(account) => {
            println!("✓ Account information retrieved");
            println!("  Address: {}", account.address);
            println!("  Balance: {} microAlgos", account.amount);
            println!("  Min balance: {} microAlgos", account.min_balance);
        }
        Err(e) => {
            println!("⚠ Could not retrieve account info: {}", e);
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Therefore there may be multiple AppCallLogs with the same application ID and outer transaction ID in the event of multiple inner app calls to the same app. App calls with no logs are not included in the response. AppCallLogs are returned in the same order that their corresponding app call appeared in the block (pre-order traversal of inner app calls)

## Error Handling

All API operations return a `Result` type. Errors include:

- Network errors (connection issues, timeouts)
- HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- Serialization errors (invalid JSON responses)

```rust
// Example error handling
match client.get_status().await {
    Ok(status) => {
        println!("Node is running on round: {}", status.last_round);
    }
    Err(error) => {
        eprintln!("Failed to get node status: {:?}", error);
        // Handle specific error types if needed
    }
}

// Or use the ? operator for early returns
let params = client.transaction_params().await
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to get transaction params: {}", e))?;
```
