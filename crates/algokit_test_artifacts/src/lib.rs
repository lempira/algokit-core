//! # AlgoKit Test Artifacts
//!
//! Centralized contract artifacts for testing across algokit-core crates.
//!
//! This crate provides static access to various Algorand contract artifacts
//! used for testing purposes. Artifacts are organized by contract name in
//! individual folders.
//!
//! Each contract has its own folder named after the contract, containing
//! standardized file names like `application.arc56.json` or `application.json`.
